   <strong> What is a Habit?</strong>
    A habit is a learned behavior that becomes automatic through repetition and practice. It is a routine or a pattern of behavior that our brains develop as a response to a particular cue or trigger in our environment. Habits are stored in our brains as neural pathways, which are like mental shortcuts that allow us to perform certain behaviors without having to consciously think about them. Once a habit is formed, it becomes a part of our daily lives and influences our actions, decisions, and outcomes.</p>
